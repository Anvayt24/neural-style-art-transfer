# neural-style-art-transfer
A project based on NEURAL STYLE TRANSFER , a technique that uses deep learning to apply the artistic style of onme imag to the content of another . 
By leveraging Convolutional neural networks (CNN's) the model captures both the content and style representations , blending them into a final output that combines the two.

i have used a pre-trained model VGG19 for feature extraction.
